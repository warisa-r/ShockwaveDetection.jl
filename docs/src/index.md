# ShockDetection.jl

ShockDetection.jl is a Julia package for detecting shocks in time series data from Godunov solver.
The packages can detect shock discontinuities for grid data with dimensions
- Nu x Nx x Nt when Nx are the number of grid points in x axis and Nt is the number of time steps in the simulation
- Nu x Nx x Ny x Nt when Nx and Ny are the number of grid points in x and y axes respectively, and Nt is the number of time steps in the simulation

The package can only process simulation files that end with .tape and .celltape. Other simulation file types are not supported!

## Features
- **Shock detection (1D and 2D)**: 
  - For 1D data (Nu x Nx x Nt): Detects shocks based on gradients using the finite difference method. 
  - For 2D data (Nu x Nx x Ny x Nt): Detects shocks based on gradients, clusters points using DBSCAN and fits optimal shock curves via the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm.
- **Visualization**: Generate shock visualizations, calculate normal vectors for 2D simulations with `create_heatmap_evo_with_shock`, or use `calculate_normal_vector` to compute vectors at specific time frames.
- **Compatibility**: Works with Julia 1.9 and 1.10.

## Installation

You can install ShockDetection.jl using the Julia package manager. From the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the Pkg REPL mode
There are several dependencies needed to run this pacakge. Check out `Project.toml` to see what packages you need to have in order to run `ShockwaveDetection.jl`

### Short guide on how to use our package on grid data with dimension Nx x Nt
When you wish to use our package to detect shock discontinuities,  you should first input your data file path into `FlowData`.
After that, define your algorithm of finite difference that best suited your simulation data and use the function `detect` to automate the detection process. The results of your detection can be found in `ShockDetectionResult1D`. You can further use various functions in visualization to see the result.

    Example:
    ```julia
    flow_data = FlowData("examples/data/supersonic_shock_2.tape")
    detection_algo = GradientShockDetectionAlgo(threshold=0.5)
    result = detect(flow_data, detection_algo)

### Short guide on how to use our package on grid data with dimension Nx x Ny x Nt
When you wish to use our package to detect shock discontinuities,  you should first input your data file path into `FlowData`.
After that, define your algorithm of finite difference, clustering, and fitting that best suited your simulation data and use
the function `detect` to automate the detection process. The results of your detection can be found in `ShockDetectionResult2D`. You can further use various functions in visualization to
see the result.

    Example:
    ```julia
    flow_data = FlowData("examples/data/sod_shock_right_2d.tape", false)
    detection_algo = ImageProcessingShockDetectionAlgo(0.5, :prewitt)
    fitting_algo = FittingAlgo(0.1, true)
    dbscan_algo = DBSCANAlgo(0.25, 3, 10)
    result = detect(flow_data, detection_algo, dbscan_algo, fitting_algo)
